# GIA - Thomas Aptitude Test

A React-based aptitude test application built with Vite that simulates the Thomas General Intelligence Assessment (GIA) test.

## Test Overview

This application simulates five cognitive tasks from the Thomas GIA test:

1. **Reasoning Task**: Problem-solving questions comparing relationships between people (e.g., "who is heavier?", "who is brighter?").
2. **Perceptual Speed**: Quick identification of matching letter pairs, testing speed and accuracy in pattern recognition.
3. **Number Speed & Accuracy**: Mental arithmetic task requiring quick comparison of number distances and relationships.
4. **Word Meaning**: Vocabulary assessment where you identify the odd word out from related terms.
5. **Spatial Visualisation**: Mental rotation task testing ability to match and compare rotated symbols.

Each task includes practice questions and is timed, typically taking 30-45 minutes to complete all five sections.

## Tech Stack

This project uses:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - UI Framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool and development server

## Vite + React

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
