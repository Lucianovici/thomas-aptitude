Introduction 
Thank you so much for taking the time to read these guidelines. The guidelines will introduce you to a series of tasks 
which will look at how quickly you pick up new information. There are five different tasks to complete, and examples 
of these tasks are presented in this booklet. This booklet will show you each of the tasks with samples of the types of 
questions and the way they will be presented on the computer.​
Upon starting, you will be presented with instructions for each task together with 8 practice examples for you to do 
before the main task begins. Although this is to be completed on a computer, you will not have to use a keyboard as you 
will select the answer to the questions by using a computer mouse. Either a mouse touchpad or a wired mouse which 
connects directly to your desktop or laptop can be used. We recommend that you use the method which you are most 
comfortable with.​
To ensure we get an accurate picture of your approach to these tasks, it is important that you work both quickly and 
accurately through each task.​
How to prepare 
Please read through this example booklet. 
If you have any special requirements, a disability or any other condition that might affect you when completing these 
tasks, please contact the person who has sent you the invitation to ensure that all reasonable adjustments have been 
made.
 
Completing each task 
Ensure you are in a quiet environment which is completely free from interruptions. 
Each task lasts between 2 and 5 minutes. You will be given 8 practice items to complete before you start each task. The 
overall series of tasks (including instructions) should last between 30 - 45 minutes. We recommend you complete all 5 
tasks consecutively in one sitting.
Please remember that both speed and accuracy are equally important. 
When you are ready to begin 
If you are completing this assessment on the premises of the organisation who has sent you the invitation, they will 
arrange a computer and mouse. Please inform them if you are left handed and prefer to have the mouse buttons 
reversed.
You may be asked to indicate the size of your screen/ monitor to ensure you are able to view the tasks on your 
computer screen.
Each task will begin by telling you a little about the task and demonstrate the method of answering questions.

Task 1: Reasoning
This is a problem solving task. Each question is about comparing two people; for example, who is heavier or lighter or 
stronger or weaker than another person.
A simple question might be:
Tom has been circled to show that Tom is the right answer. 
A slightly more difficult question may be: 
A more difficult question may be:

You can study this statement for as long as you need to understand it fully, although the task requires you to work as 
quickly and accurately as possible. When you are ready you must click the mouse. 
When you have done this the statement will disappear and a question about the statement will be shown together with 
two possible answers thus:
You must now move the cursor to the box which contains the correct answer. In this example you should click on the 
box with Bob in it. When you have done this, the next question will appear and so on until the end of the task.

Task 2: Perceptual Speed 
The objective for this task is to identify how fast and accurate you are in checking things in your head. 
For example:
In this case, you will see four pairs of letters. Each pair has been put into its own box. You must decide how many pairs 
contain letters that are the same. 
In this task capital letters (like F) are the same as small letters (like f). In the example above the ﬁrst pair of letters  
(E and e) is the same; so are the third and fourth pairs (D and d) and (K and k). The second pair of letters (Q and y)  
is not the same. 
So, you can count three pairs with the same letters. The answer is 3. As you see above, 3 has been marked as the 
answer.

Each task question will have ﬁve possible answers shown in ﬁve boxes, numbered 0 – 4. 
In this example, the ﬁrst pair (f and F) is the same letter. 
The second and fourth pairs (d and D; h and H) are matching pairs too. 
The third pair of letters (m and R) is not the same letter. 
Therefore, in this example there are 3 pairs of the same letter, so the correct answer is 3 and you should move the 
cursor to the box with the number 3 in it and click there to select that answer. 
Like the other examples, you need to study each question, identify the number of pairs that have the same letters and 
point and click on the correct answer. 
Please work as quickly and accurately as possible. 
Here are some more examples. 
The correct answers have been indicated.

Task 3: Number Speed & Accuracy 
This task measures your speed and accuracy in carrying out number tasks in your head. For each question presented, 
start by ﬁnding the highest and the lowest of the three numbers displayed. 
Having identiﬁed those, decide whether the highest number or the lowest number is numerically further away from the 
remaining number. 
For example: 
As you will see, the 2 is the lowest number and the 8 is the highest number. 
The remaining number is 4. The number 8 is four away from the remaining number 4, and the number 2 is two away 
from the number 4. Therefore 8 is furthest away from 4, and is circled above as the correct answer. 
Three steps are needed to ﬁnd the correct answer. 
STEP 1. Working in your head, identify which number is the highest and which is the lowest. 
STEP 2. Still in your head, identify which of those two (the highest or the lowest number) is numerically further away 
from the number that remains.
STEP 3. Select the answer.
Here is another example:
In this example 12 is the right answer and it has been marked accordingly. Here is why the answer is 12:  
The highest number is 12. The lowest number is 3. The remaining number is 5. 12 is seven away from 5, and 3 is two 
away from 5. So the correct answer to the question is 12.

5 is the lowest and 10 is the highest. 10 is numerically further from the remaining number 7 than 5 is, and so the 
answer to the question is 10 and you should click on the box with 10 in it. 
Here is another example: 
The answer to this example is 16 and you should click on the box with 16 in it. Please work as quickly and accurately  
as possible.

Task 4: Word Meaning 
This is a task to see how quickly you can spot the odd word out in a group. You will be given three words. Two of the 
three will be related in some way, and the third is the odd one out. Each time, decide which word is the odd one out and 
click on it. 
For example: 
The odd word is cold, because the other two words are similar in some way. 
Here is another example:
Below and under have the same meaning and so the odd word is letter. For each question you should click on the box 
which has contains the odd word. Please work as quickly and accurately as possible. 
Up and down are opposites. So therefore the odd word out is street. 
Another example:

Here are some more challenging examples:

"ephemeral - eternal - transient"
The odd word out is eternal, as both ephemeral and transient refer to things that are temporary or short-lived.

"ubiquitous - omnipresent - sporadic"
The odd word out is sporadic, as both ubiquitous and omnipresent mean being present everywhere.

"cacophony - euphony - dissonance"
The odd word out is euphony, as both cacophony and dissonance refer to harsh or unpleasant sounds.

"perspicacious - obtuse - astute"
The odd word out is obtuse, as both perspicacious and astute refer to having a keen understanding or insight.

"surreptitious - clandestine - conspicuous"
The odd word out is conspicuous, as both surreptitious and clandestine refer to things done secretly.

"phlegmatic - stoic - volatile"
The odd word out is volatile, as both phlegmatic and stoic refer to being calm and unemotional.

Please work as quickly and accurately as possible to identify the odd word out in each group.

Task 5: Spatial Visualisation 
This task is designed to see how quickly you can rotate shapes/symbols in your head. Some symbols are paired with 
exactly the same symbol (which has been rotated), and some are paired with a mirror image (which has been rotated). 
The challenge is to see and count how many boxes contain a matching pair and then circle that number. 
For demonstration purposes, the pairs have had boxes drawn around them to show each pair separately. 
R
The two basic symbols used in this task and rotated on the page are: 
Look at these two symbols and you will see that no matter how many times they are rotated they can never match. 
For example: 
R
Each pair has two symbols. This task requires you to identify whether the bottom symbol in the box is identical to the 
top symbol, or is a mirror image of the top symbol. In all three pairs above, the bottom symbol never matches the top 
symbol, no matter how it is rotated because it is a mirror image. In other words, it looks like the top symbol reﬂected in 
a mirror. 
In each pair above the two symbols are different because they cannot be rotated to match each other exactly. 
Here is another example:
In the boxes above, for each box the symbol on the bottom always matches the symbol on top because they can be 
rotated to match the top symbol exactly. 
and its mirror image

Look at the examples below. 
How many symbols on the bottom are the same as those directly above them, after they are rotated? Compare each 
symbol with the one directly above it. 
Check you understand why these answers are correct! In each question you have to show how many pairs are the 
same. 
The two symbols in the ﬁrst pair (in the ﬁrst white box) are not the same. The two symbols in the second pair are the 
same symbols but rotated. The answer, as shown above, would be 1 because one pair consist of symbols that are the 
same. 
Please work both as quickly and accurately as possible.
